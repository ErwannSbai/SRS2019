    "- Choosing a regression specification, i.e., selecting the variables to be included in a regression model, is a difficult task. \n",
    "- However, there are some guidelines on how to proceed; the goal is clear: obtaining an unbiased and precise estimate of the causal effect of interest. \n",
    "- As a starting point, think about omitted variables, that is, to avoid possible bias by using suitable control variables.\n",
    "- A second step could be to compare different specifications by measures of fit. However, as we shall see one should not rely solely on $\\bar{R}^2$."
