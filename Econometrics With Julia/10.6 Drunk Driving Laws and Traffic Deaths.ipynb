    "- There are two major sources of omitted variable bias that are not accounted for by all of the models of the relation between traffic fatalities and beer taxes that we have considered so far: economic conditions and driving laws. \n",
    "- Fortunately, Fatalities has data on state-specific legal drinking age (drinkage), punishment (jail, service) and various economic indicators like unemployment rate (unemp) and per capita income (income). \n",
    "- We may use these covariates to extend the preceding analysis.\n",
    "- These covariates are defined as follows:\n",
    " - unemp: a numeric variable stating the state specific unemployment rate.\n",
    " - log(income): the logarithm of real per capita income (in prices of 1988).\n",
    " - miles: the state average miles per driver.\n",
    " - drinkage: the state specify minimum legal drinking age.\n",
    " - drinkagc: a discretized version of drinkage that classifies states into four categories of minimal drinking age; 18, 19, 20, 21 and older. These categories are included as dummy regressors where [21,22] is chosen as the reference category.\n",
    " - punish: a dummy variable with levels yes and no that measures if drunk driving is severely punished by mandatory jail time or mandatory community service (first conviction)."
